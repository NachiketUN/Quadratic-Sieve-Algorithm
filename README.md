# Quadratic-Sieve
Quadratic Sieve Algorithm implementation in Python.

It is mainly used to factor very Large Number(10 digits or more) depending on the sieve interval.

The algorithm is single-polynomial version.

It factors an integer N, using a chosen factor base of P primes, and a sieve interval.
